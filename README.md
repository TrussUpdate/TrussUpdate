# README #

This folder contains all codes of paper "Probabilistic Truss Decompostion on Uncertain Graphs: Indexing and Dynamic Maintenance".

## This folder contains the following: ##
* **APX-Index**: APX-Index code folder, APX-Index algorithm proposed in the paper, builds the index from the graph.
* **APX-Update**: APX-Update code folder, APX-Update algorithm proposed in the paper, updates the index when the graph changes.

For CPT-Index, you can set small enough parameters of APX-Index, i.e., (0.000001, 0.000001).
More detailed README is in each subdirectory.
